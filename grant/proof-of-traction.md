**SignerListSet state on chain:** 3-of-4 (after scenario 3.8 expansion)
— originally 2-of-3, rotated through scenarios 3.5–3.7, expanded in 3.8.

**Ten transaction hashes** from the failure-mode test suite, all on
XRPL testnet, all click-through to the live explorer:

**How to verify independently:** each hash above is a clickable link to
the XRPL testnet explorer. Every transaction shows the multisig
`Signers[]` array with the 3 (or 4) enclave account addresses and their
DER-encoded signatures. No authorization is needed to view.

## 3. DCAP remote attestation (hardware proof)

All 3 Azure DCsv3 nodes return a valid 4,734-byte Intel-signed SGX
Quote v3 via `POST /v1/pool/attestation-quote`:

```bash
# From any Azure DCsv3 node (loopback, requires SSH to operator host)
curl -sk -X POST https://localhost:9088/v1/pool/attestation-quote \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_data":"0xdeadbeef"}'
# → {"quote_hex":"0x03000200...","quote_size":4734,"status":"success"}
```

**Structure of a returned quote:**

- 2-byte header version (0x0300 — Quote v3)
- 2-byte attestation key type (0x0002 — ECDSA P-256)
- Reserved fields
- QE vendor ID
- User data (the 64-byte blob we passed in: `0xdeadbeef` padded to 64)
- Report body: MRENCLAVE, MRSIGNER, ISVPRODID, ISVSVN, CPUSVN, etc.
- Signature data: PCK certificate chain + QE3 report + quote signature

**Verification path (what a third party would do):**

1. Parse the 4,734-byte blob per [Intel SGX DCAP ECDSA Quote v3 format](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/latest/dcap-latest/linux/docs/Intel_SGX_ECDSA_QuoteLibReference_DCAP_API.pdf)
2. Extract the PCK certificate chain
3. Verify the chain against Intel's SGX Root CA
4. Verify the QE3 report signature against the PCK cert
5. Verify the user quote signature against the QE3-issued attestation key
6. Extract the MRENCLAVE and compare against the hash of the published
   enclave.signed.so in our GitHub release

Our deployment docs walk through this:
`xrpl-perp-dex-enclave/EthSignerEnclave/docs/azure_dcap_deployment.md`

**Known issues we documented while making DCAP work on new Azure VMs:**

- `AZDCAP_DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL` must be set or the Azure DCAP client pollutes
  stdout of any child process
- Freshly-created VMs may need `az vm deallocate` + `az vm start` to
  land on a host with provisioned PCK certificates in Azure THIM

These hours-of-debugging-turned-into-one-paragraph moments are
documented so future grant teams don't rediscover them.

## 4. Multi-operator sequencer election (live verified)

`research/election-split-brain-test-report.md` documents end-to-end
verification on the live 3-node Azure cluster, including:

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Stable cluster, 5 min | ✅ zero false failovers |
| Kill sequencer → failover | ✅ 16.5 s (timeout = 15 s) |
| Restart sequencer → reclaim | ✅ 8 s |
| Network partition via `iptables DROP` | ✅ minority keeps old leader, majority elects new |
| Reconverge after reconnect | ✅ 3 s to single-leader state |
| Persistent libp2p peer_id | ✅ stable across restarts |
| Heartbeat debug observability | ✅ `RUST_LOG=...election=debug` |

Code: `orchestrator/src/election.rs` (509 lines, 10 unit tests),
`orchestrator/src/p2p.rs` (395 lines, 2 unit tests), wired in
`orchestrator/src/main.rs`.

## 4b. Passive cross-operator PostgreSQL replication (verified live)

Historical data (trades, liquidations, deposits) is stored in PostgreSQL
on each operator. To make sure all three operators have consistent
history regardless of which one served the original request, the
validator batch replay loop writes the same rows that the sequencer
wrote — relying on `ON CONFLICT (trade_id, market) DO NOTHING` for
idempotency.

Verified end-to-end on the live 3-node Azure cluster on 2026-04-09:

```
alice: limit SELL 10 @ 1.00 submitted at sgx-node-1 (sequencer)
bob:   market BUY  10 @ market submitted at sgx-node-1
       → matched, trade_id = 1 produced by the sequencer

5 seconds later, querying the local PostgreSQL on each node:

  sgx-node-1 | 1 | alice | bob | 1.0 | 10.0   ← wrote via submit_order
  sgx-node-2 | 1 | alice | bob | 1.0 | 10.0   ← wrote via validator replay
  sgx-node-3 | 1 | alice | bob | 1.0 | 10.0   ← wrote via validator replay
```

Propagation path: REST → CLOB match → `api.rs::submit_order` writes to
local PG → sequencer publishes OrderBatch via libp2p gossipsub →
validators deserialize and hit `validator_perp.open_position()` on
their local enclaves AND `db.insert_trade()` on their local PG. Total
latency from order submission to row present on all 3 PGs: <5 seconds.

Reproducer: `tests/test_b31_replication.py` in the repo. Schema
migration for existing databases: `orchestrator/migrations/001_passive_replication_idempotency.sql`.
