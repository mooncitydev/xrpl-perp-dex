# xrpl-perp-dex

Perpetual futures DEX on XRPL mainnet with TEE (Intel SGX) computation layer and RLUSD settlement.

## Architecture

XRPL mainnet has no smart contracts. We use a TEE coprocessor to bridge that gap:

```

                                 ├── RLUSD collateral custody
                                 ├── P&L settlement
                                 └── Deposit / withdrawal
```

- **Computation**: Intel SGX enclave — order matching, margin, funding, liquidation
- **Settlement**: XRPL mainnet — RLUSD transfers, collateral custody via omnibus account
- **Trust model**: users trust attested enclave code + XRPL validators; operator is trusted only for liveness

## Key Properties

- **Anti-MEV**: orders encrypted with enclave's attested public key; operator sees only ciphertext
- **RLUSD-native**: all collateral, settlement, and fees denominated in RLUSD
- **Verifiable**: remote attestation proves enclave code integrity; signed execution reports for every trade
- **No sidechain**: settles directly on XRPL L1
